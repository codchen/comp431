What did you hope to learn but did not?

Workflow from development, staging, and final deployment
How to use nginx/how to create a load balancer

What did you really enjoy learning about?

All technologies used are up to date and popular so it's not hard to find
documentations

What worked well in the course? and how?

The incremental development of the final application. It'd be hard to do it
if you just throw it as a whole at us and give us like two months to complete
it, like some other course.

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?

Some packages used in inclass exercises are outdated and could cause great 
confusions (e.g. used webpack 1 instead of 2, which is in many ways different)

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design 
of in class exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!

Maybe have links of detailed introductions for the technologies you mentioned 
in class, given there are so many of them and you can possibly explain them
all by yourself

Anything else you like to say?

I'm not sure about this but I feel like for our project it'd make more sense
to use a relational database. True that we are not building a banking app but 
I feel like everything is indexed (_id, commentId, username) and we don't 
really need so much flexibility provided by NoSQL. Relational databse is still
around and I guess a student coming out of a web dev course is expected to know
how to write some basic SQLs. Just a thought.
